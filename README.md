# C1PK-Flood: (A hybrid model integrating the C1PKNet and the PyFlood models)
> A hybrid system integrating a machine learning model (C1PKNet; Lee et al., 2021) and a static model (PyFlood; Santos Cruz et al., 2024) to generate high-resolution inundation maps for the Galveston area. 


# C1PK-Flood model running process

## C1PKNet_training.py  
Code for training the C1PKNet model. 
The input data consists of time-series of six storm parameters, and the output data represents the peak storm surge values at 1,217 points. To determine the optimal time-series, we compared a total of 215 combinations. We selected data spanning from 4 hours before landfall to 6 hours after landfall for the input time-series data.

## Cross-validation_plotting.py
Code for cross-validation result
Nested 10-fold cross-validation was performed, and a density scatter plot was generated to compare the ADCIRC-simulated peak storm surge values with the C1PKNet-predicted peak storm surge values.

## PyFlood_Preprocessing.py
Code for preprocessing 
The DEM data is transformed to ensure compatibility with the C1PK-Flood model by converting the coordinate reference system to decimal degrees and replacing cells with NaN values with valid data. The processed file is then saved for running the C1PK-Flood model.

## main_C1PK_Flood.py
Code for running the C1PK-Flood model. 
The results of the C1PKNet model are used as input data for the PyFlood model, which ultimately generates a high-resolution inundation map for the Galveston area in TIFF format.
